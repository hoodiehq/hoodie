Hoodie API
==========

Hoodie provides two APIs

1. The Hoodie Client API

   The Hoodie Client API is what you load into your web application using a
   script tag. It connects to your Hoodie Backend's routes


2. The Hoodie Server API

   The Hoodie Server API is used within Hoodieâ€™s route handlers and by plugins
   to manage accounts, data and to securely integrate with 3rd party services.

This library, commonly called **Hoodie Client**, is what you'll be
working with on the client side. It consists of:

-  `The Hoodie Client API <client/hoodie.html>`__, which has
   a couple of useful helpers
-  `The account API <client/hoodie.account.html>`__,
   which lets you do user authentication, such as signing users up, in
   and out
-  `The store API <client/hoodie.store.html>`__,
   which provides means to store and retrieve data for each individial
   user
-  `The connectionStatus API <client/hoodie.connection-status.html>`__,
   which provides helpers for connectivity.
-  `The log API <client/hoodie.log.html>`__, which
   provides a nice API for logging all the things

The Hoodie Server API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hoodie Server API is currently work-in-progress. But you can have a look
at the `Account Server API <https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-server-api>`__
and the `Store Server API <https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-server-api>`__
for a sneak peak.
