hoodie.account
==============

The account object in the client-side Hoodie API covers all user and
authentication-related operations, and enables you to do previously
complex operations, such as signing up a new user, with only a few lines
of frontend code. Since `data in Hoodie is generally bound to a
user </camp/hoodieverse/glossary.html#private-user-store>`__, it makes
sense to familiarise yourself with **account** before you move on to
`store </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.store.html>`__.

This is work in progress
