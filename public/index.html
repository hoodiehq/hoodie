    <h1>Hello from Hoodie Server!</h1>

    <p> You see this because your app has no <code>public/</code> folder.</p> 
    <p> But don't worry, we're here to get you started! </p>
    <h2>Get going with Hoodie</h2>
    <p>Your first step should be creating a <code>public</code> 
    folder inside your project folder.</p>
    <p>Next up, just create your <strong>index.html</strong>
    inside that public directory.</p>
    <p>We're almost here: Paste this into your <strong>index.html
    </strong> just before your closing tag for the body:
    <strong> &lt;script src="hoodie/client.js"&gt;&lt;script&gt;</strong></p>
    <p> This is necessary for your own javascript files
    to pick up the hoodie methods.</p>
    <p> Now handle it just like you would handle your frontend project, 
    hoodie won't get in your way. </p>
    <p> Setup your asset folders and create your .css and .js files.</p>
    <p> Happy coding :)</p>
