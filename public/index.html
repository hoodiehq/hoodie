    <h1>Hello from Hoodie!</h1>

    <p>You see this because your app has no <code>public/</code> folder.</p>
    <p>But don't worry, we're here to get you started! </p>

    <h2>Get going with Hoodie</h2>

    <p>Your first step should be creating a <code>public</code> folder inside your project folder.</p>
    <p>Next up, just create your <strong>index.html</strong> inside that public directory.</p>
    <p>We're almost here: Paste this into your <strong>index.html</strong> just before your closing tag for the body: <strong> &lt;script src="hoodie/client.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</strong></p>
    <p>This is necessary for your own javascript files to pick up the hoodie methods.</p>
    <p>Now handle it just like you would handle your frontend project, hoodie won't get in your way. </p>
    <p>Setup your asset folders and create your .css and .js files.</p>
    <p>You’ll need to restart the Hoodie server so it servers assets from your app’s <code>public</code> folder</p>
