[back to hoodie](../README.md)

# hoodie/server

After [installing hoodie](../#setup), `npm start` will run [cli/index.js](../cli/start.js)
which reads out [configuration](../#usage) from all the different places using
the [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc) package, then passes it as options to
[server/index.js](../server/index.js), the Hoodie core [hapi plugin](http://hapijs.com).

In [server/index.js](../server/index.js) the passed options are amended with defaults and parsed
into configuration for the Hapi server. It passes the configuration on to [hoodie-server]('#hoodie-server'),
which combines the core server modules. It also bundles the Hoodie client on first request to `/hoodie/client.js`
and passes in the configuration for the client. It also makes the app’s `public` folder accessible at
the `/` root path, and Hoodie’s Core UIs at `/hoodie/admin`, `/hoodie/account` and `/hoodie/store`.

Hoodie uses [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) for data persistence and
authentication. If `options.dbUrl` is not set, it falls back to [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/).

Once all configuration is taken care of, the internal plugins are initialised
(see [server/plugins/index.js](plugins/index.js)). We define simple Hapi plugins
for [logging](plugins/log.js) and for [serving the app’s public assets and the Hoodie client](plugins/public.js).

Once everything is setup, the server is then started at the end of [cli/start.js](../cli/start.js)
and the URL where hoodie is running is logged to the terminal.

## Architecture

Hoodie is a server built on top of [hapi](http://hapijs.com) with frontend APIs
for account and store related tasks.
