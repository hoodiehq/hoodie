## Installation

`npm install --save hoodie@camp`

_Note_: This is still a developer preview. Look at [Hoodie’s new Tracker App](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker) to get the current stable Hoodie install.

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "hoodie"
}
```
Before your first run, you need to set the admin panel password. The doesn't really work yet, so just do `npm start -- --admin-password 123` when you do this the first time.

That's it! From now on, running `npm start` will now serve a hoodie-app from your `www` folder.

Run `npm start -- --help` to see more options.
