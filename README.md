Hoodie lets you build apps [without _thinking_ about the backend](http://nobackend.org/)
and makes sure that they work great [independent from connectivity](http://offlinefirst.org/).

This is Hoodie’s main repository. It starts a server and serves the client API.
Read more about [how the Hoodie server works](server).

A good place to start is our [Tracker App](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker).
You can play around with Hoodie’s APIs in the browser console and see how it
works all together in its [simple HTML & JavaScript code](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/tree/master/public).

If you have any questions come say hi in our [chat](http://hood.ie/chat/).

## Usage

Run `npm start -- --help` to see all available CLI options.

Options can also be specified as environment variables (prefixed with `hoodie_`) or inside a `.hoodierc` file (json or ini).

configuration from CLI arguments, environment variables and configuration files.

```
git clone https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.git
cd hoodie

of the [public folder](public).
