## Setup

`npm install --save hoodie@camp`

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "hoodie"
}
```

Now run `npm start` to start your Hoodie app.

## Usage

Run `npm start -- --help` to see all available CLI options.

Options can also be specified as environment variables (prefixed with "hoodie_") or inside a ".hoodierc" file (json or ini).

## Testing

The `hoodie` test suite is run with `npm test`.

The tests live in `test/unit` and `test/integration`. `test/unit` tests (or ‚Äúunit tests‚Äù) are to test the behaviour of individual sub-modules within `hoodie`, while `test/integration` tests (or ‚Äúintegration tests‚Äù) are used to test the behaviour of a fully running instance of `hoodie`, e.g. the behaviour of its HTTP API.

If you are adding new features to `hoodie` you should provide test cases for the new feature. Depending on the feature, it's either best to write unit tests or integration tests and sometimes even both. The more tests we have, the more confidently we can release future versions of `hoodie`.


## Architecture

Hoodie is server built on top of [hapi](http://hapijs.com) with frontend APIs
for account and store related tasks.

It consists of three main components

1. [**account**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account)  
   Hoodie‚Äôs account module. It exposes a [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/), a
   a corresponding client and a generic account UI.

1. [**store**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store)  
   Hoodie‚Äôs store module. It exposes [CouchDB‚Äôs Document API](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API),
   a corresponding client and a generic store UI.

1. [**client**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client)  
   Hoodie‚Äôs front-end client for the browser. It integrates the following client modules:
   1. [account-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-client)
   2. [store-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-client)
   3. [log-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-log-client)
   4. [connection-status](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-connection-status)
