Hoodie lets you build apps [without _thinking_ about the backend](http://nobackend.org/)
and makes sure that they work great [independent of connectivity](http://offlinefirst.org/).

This is Hoodie’s main repository. It starts a server and serves the client API.
Read more about [How the Hoodie server works](server).

A good place to start is our [Tracker App](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker).
You can play around with Hoodie’s APIs in the browser console and see how it
works all together in its [simple HTML and JavaScript code](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/tree/master/public).

If you have any questions come and say hi in our [chat](http://hood.ie/chat/).
